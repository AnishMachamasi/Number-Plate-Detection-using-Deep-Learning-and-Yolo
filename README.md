# Vehicle Number Plate Recognition Detection using Deep Learning and Yolo


In this project, i have implemented both deep learning and yolo for Vehicle Number plate detection respectively.

Get high-accuracy, developer-friendly **automatic license plate recognition** ([ALPR](https://platerecognizer.com/?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=website)) or automatic number plate recognition ([ANPR](https://platerecognizer.com/?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=website)) software! The core of our ALPR, ANPR system is based on state of the art deep neural networks architectures.
